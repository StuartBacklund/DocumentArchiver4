Application Setup


	1- Set up a folder structure that is easily accessible
	2- 2- I found the best way is to have two folders, one contains the files ready to be compiled, the other as a staging area for new documents. I usually just do  a quick scan of the documents in the staging folder for things like correct file extensions, valid document names (no special characters)
	3- Unzip the resources zip file, it contains a few images and 2 CSS stylesheets
	4- These style sheets are essential for the way the chm component operates internally
	5- Execute the install MSI, follow the prompts
	6- The installer should install a start menu item, if not, the executable will be found under program files X86
	7- Depending on how tight your user access rights are setup, you might have to give the executable rights to run under an admin account



Proposed folder structure 
Use C:\Articles\Articles\ as the main location and C:\Articles\Article Dump for staging









Contents of zipped resources file: extract them into your folder where all
Your documents are ready to be compiled![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7d0aeab-6e4b-4620-a66b-4ea4e8b4369d)
